Hi there!, I'm Mauricio Gaston Pineda, as you already heard, a fool who fell in love with programming. But that is not enough with more passion I went through several languages, from C++, VisualBasic, C#, VB.net, PHP, Android, Flutter, and lots of others that were just for fun.

But, my best skill is in Magento, since started with Mage in 2008 I never stopped work on it. Both versions 1 and 2, and I can take any sides front-end or back-end, but my preferred is the back-end.

Do you want to know which is my machine setup?:
- PopOS! (debian/ubuntu)

Do you want to know which are my tools?:
- Docker
